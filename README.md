# WikiProfes
This repository corresponds to the final project for the Software Engineering course at CUCEI. It is a website developed with Django and SQLite, serving as a professor recommendation system. Users can consult and create reviews for professors at the University of Guadalajara. Additionally, users can search for reviews by subject or professor through a search system. Each subject and professor has a profile page that contains their respective reviews and evaluations, both individually and overall.
