This repository contains the final project for the Software Engineering course at CUCEI. It is a comprehensive web application developed using Django and SQLite, designed to serve as a professor recommendation system for the University of Guadalajara.

**Project Overview**

The primary goal of this system is to allow users to consult and create reviews for professors at the University of Guadalajara. This facilitates students in making informed decisions when selecting their courses and professors.

**Key Features**

* User Authentication: Users can register and log in to the system to access its features.
* Review System: Authenticated users can create and edit reviews for professors.
* Search Functionality: Users can search for reviews by subject or professor, enabling easy access to the information they need.
* Profile and Subject Pages: Each subject and professor and subject has a dedicated profile page displaying their overall and individual reviews and evaluations.
* User Interface: A user-friendly interface that ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience.

**Technologies Used**

* Django: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
* SQLite: A lightweight, disk-based database that doesnâ€™t require a separate server process and allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language.
* HTML/CSS: For creating the structure and styling of the web pages.
* JavaScript: For enhancing the user interface and providing interactive features.
* Bootstrap: A popular front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
